## **Day 1** (06/26/2025)

* Did research on how RC Cars work!  
  * Compared motors based on KV and found out about RMPS!  
  * Found out 3650 3900KV motors are good for short bursts and good midrange RPM  
  * Decided on the Surpass Rocket 3650 3900KV motor with a 60A waterproof ESC (Took so long to find on Aliexpress!!!!)
* Picked Sakura D5 chassis, which already has 90% of everything I need, which will reduce costs! 
* For the receiver, went with the Flysky FS-iA6B since I already have a compatible transmitter   
* On the battery side of things, I decided on a dual 5200mAh 4S HOOVO would be perfect!  
  * Side note: This thing will be FFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAASTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!  
* Finalized BOM and added everything to my cart to get an idea of the real-world cost

## **Day 2** (06/27/2025)

* Started to model the RC Car body to be aerodynamic
* Made the rough sketch of where the wheels go and the front and rear bumper
* Extruded the sketch to 130 mm, which is perfect for a 1/10 RC Car

Rough sketch!

## **Day 3** (06/28/2025)

* Refined the Fusion 360 model
* Added the side profile of the car and made sure each wheel had clearance (15mm on each side)
* The tire cut out ended up being 95mm, which allows it to clear basically every tire I will run
* I then extruded every part that is basically "Trash"
* Allowed me to make a rough car shape!
